# Cyclone Physics Engine

This repository is a "playground" for the book [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.crcpress.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-How-to-Build-a-Robust-Commercial-Grade/Millington/p/book/9780123819765) by [Ian Millington](https://github.com/idmillington). The book uses C++ and GLUT to demonstrate game physics concepts, and author's original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).

Instead of C++ and GLUT, this repo uses the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to implement a physics engine, and [Kiss3d](https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d) graphics library to handle rendering and user-input part. Hopefully, one day, this repo will contain complete (Rust) port of author's original C++ code.
